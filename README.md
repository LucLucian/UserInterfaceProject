### Overview

 Maven Selenium testing framework in Java using Page Object Pattern
 
### Motivation

* For browser automation, Iâ€™ve decided to go with Selenium WebDriver because is the go-to standard for browser automation. Most important benefits are Advanced Browser Interactions, Mouse and Keyboard simulation, Cross Browser compability, Cross Device compability, easy to extend with personalized extensions.
* I choose to create as Maven project because is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation, no need to install any other dependencies.
* IntelliJ because is a programming environment largely meant for Java and integrates great with Maven, Selenium and TestNG.
* For running tests and performing assertions, I decided to go with TestNG and it integrates very nicely with IntelliJ and is an automation testing framework in which NG stands for "Next Generation". TestNG is inspired from JUnit which uses the annotations (@).
